# xlabs-api-haxe
haXe library for the Xlabs api 

### What is this?
This is a convered and augmented API originally provided in Javscript by the Xlabs team.  
You can use this haxe library to create awesome web applications in chrome that [track your vision on the screen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-89g5turCJQ) with just your built-in webcam.

Only target available is for web/javascript.

### Aims of this library?

 * Assist with development with type-safety
 * Extend the existing interface for easier data retrieval
 * Enable haXe developers to use this awesome technology

### How do I use it?
There are various samples provided in the [xLabs demos](https://github.com/drawlinson/xlabs-demo) repository, however these are in javascript.  

If time permits, I will convert a couple of these to haXe.
